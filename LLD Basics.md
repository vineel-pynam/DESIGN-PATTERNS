### Encapsulation:
- It is the process of wrapping up code and data together in a single unit(Class).
- We restrict direct access to some members/components of the class.
- **Ex:** Getters and Setters Methods are used to set values to variables defined in the class instead of accessing directly from the instance of the class object.
- We use Access Modifiers to control the access to the members of the class.

### Access Modifiers: 
- **Private:**
	- Methods/Variables can only be accessed by the class itself. They cannot be accessed outside the class.
- **Protected:**
	- Methods/Variables can only be accessed by the class and sub-classes. In java, they can be accessed by all classes within the same package.
- **Public:**
	- Methods/Variables can be accessed outside the class.

### Abstraction
- It is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user and showing only functionality to the user.
- It can be achieved by Abstract Classes, Interfaces.
- Abstract Classes or Interfaces cannot be instantiated on it's own and is meant to be inherited by concrete classes.
- **Abstract Classes:**
	- Can have abstract and non abstract methods.
	- Abstract methods must be implemented by the derived classes.
- **Interfaces**
	- It has only abstract methods.

### Inheritance
- It is a process in which sub/derived - classes acquire/use methods and properties from the parent class.
