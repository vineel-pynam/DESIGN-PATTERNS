### Encapsulation:
- It is the process of wrapping up code and data together in a single unit(Class).
- We restrict direct access to some members/components of the class.
- **Ex:** Getters and Setters Methods are used to set values to variables defined in the class instead of accessing directly from the instance of the class object.
- We use Access Modifiers to control the access to the members of the class.


### Access Modifiers: 
- **PRIVATE:**
	- Methods/Variables can only be accessed by the class itself. They cannot be accessed outside the class.
- **Protected:**
	- Methods/Variables can only be accessed by the class and sub-classes. In java, they can be accessed by all classes within the same package.
- **Public:**
	- Methods/Variables can be accessed outside the class.
